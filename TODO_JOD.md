`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_0ieeylze6dv47vimqz8rok5ci_>` Make sure `jodliterate` works for direction definitions, see:  [`TODO_jodliterate.md`](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/jodliterate/TODO_jodliterate.md).

2. `<_31t8dofxlypuuaflswoq784pp_>` Test `jodliterate` on macOS and Linux. Tweak if needed.

3. `<_77ozevqhpzugqsgru959hbqp2_>` Improve and extend `JOD` labs and insure they run on later J systems. Labs have changed in recent J versions.

4. `<_6kfjobpvb6ikszgzq1m9t9aub_>` Consider adding a new appendix to `jod.pdf` describing how to run JOD tests.

5. `<_4bbeyvpi7x7t543s8zl3vn0i9_>` Consider adding a `bdisp` verb that would work like `disp` but show objects in backups.

6. `<_d1dtfkd14ypvlatnch2pa5hwo_>` Consider allowing `~/` as a path prefix on macOS and Linux systems. The home directory convention on these systems is respected by `dir`.
