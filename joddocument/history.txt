### 0.9.80 - July 13, 2012

 * references to Mac version and `joddocument` addon added 

### 0.9.76 - June 20, 2012

 * PDF JOD documentation split off into a separate addon. The main
   file `jod.pdf` is relatively stable and almost ten times the size
   of the core JOD addon. It has been removed from the core JOD addon
   to reduce download times. [`jod.pdf`](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/)
   has been available on the JOD Page for users to download and 
   copy to the correct `jodhelp` directory but with the 
   proliferation of J platforms and JOD versions this is getting 
   messy. It's easier to use JAL to distribute this file and change
   `jodhelp` to look in this addon's directories.
