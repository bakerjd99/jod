`jod` README
============

This repository contains distributed [J language](http://www.jsoftware.com/) 
[JOD addon](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jod) source code.
More information about JOD is available on [The JOD Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/).

The directories [`jod`](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/tree/master/jod) and 
[`jodsource`](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/tree/master/jodsource) contain
the J addon code distributed by [JAL](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/JAL/User%20Guide) in the
[`jod`](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jod) and 
[`jodsource`](http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Addons/general/jodsource) addons.

JOD addon code is "compressed": whitespace and comments have been removed
and *safe local identifiers* have been reduced to single characters. Compression
significantly reduces the size of code at the expense of *readability.* To
make casual browsing of JOD code easy, *without building JOD dictionaries*, the 
directory [`jodijs`](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/tree/master/jodijs) contains
fully commented JOD source. `jodijs` is not distributed by JAL.
