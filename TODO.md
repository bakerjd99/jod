to see what *actually got implemented*. Plans do not necessarily materialize.

For years I have maintained a private project log that includes
`JOD` work. I never "published" this document for the simple reason
that I didn't want to imply that I am committing to anything. Now I am committing
to finishing the few remaining `JOD` features.

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_57gpdh1nm20c5b2lg60doiaaf_>` Refine the `jodliterate` PDF JOD source code document. Now that
   I've resurrected `jodliterate` and revised it for current versions of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
   I can improve the source code presentation document. See the related  [`TODO_jodliterate.md`](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jacks/blob/master/jodliterate/TODO_jodliterate.md).

2. `<_77ozevqhpzugqsgru959hbqp2_>` Improve and extend `JOD` labs and insure they run on later J systems. Labs
   have changed in recent J versions.

`[end-todo]`
