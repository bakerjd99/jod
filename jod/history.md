general/jod - change history
============================

### 1.0.1 - March 28, 2020 (Social Distancing Edition)

 * `jodcube.ico` and `jodcube.png`added.
    
    see: `jpath '~/addons/general/jod/joddoc'`

    Useful for setting OS icons that brand JOD directories.

 *  (setbuilddirs) modified to create all the directories
    required by the macro (buildjoddistribution). This simplifies
    setting up new machines for building JOD addons. 

 *  `addloadscript1` now insures scripts added to `~config\startup.ijs`
    have `.ijs` extensions. 

### 1.0.0 - December 9, 2019 (Feature Complete Release)

 * `bget` implemented - see `jod.pdf` With this addition all
    planned JOD features are complete. From now on JOD
    changes will consist of bug fixes and optimizations.
    Stability is now the goal.

 * [`bget` Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/blob/master/jodnotebooks/Using%20JOD%20Backup%20Get.ipynb)

 * some macros and tests adjusted to support 18!:4 changes.

 * new `bget` test cases in JOD source dictionaries.

### 0.9.999 - August 29, 2019

 * patch release fixes startup failure for J 9.01 beta-h and beyond.

 * `MAXNAME` increased to 128 from 60. This parameter controls the maximum
    length of j names that can be stored in JOD. It can be set to
    values between 1 and 255.

 *  `rm`, `rtt` adjusted to support changes to `18!:4`.

### 0.9.998 - February 14, 2019 (Valentine's Day)

 * `rxs` implemented - see `jod.pdf`

 * [`rxs` Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/blob/master/jodnotebooks/Using%20JOD%20Regular%20Expressions.ipynb)

 * Jupyter notebook versions of JOD labs see:
   [JOD lab notebooks](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod/tree/master/jodnotebooks)

### 0.9.996 - October 14, 2018

 * `mnl` implemented - see `jod.pdf`

 * `et` adjusted to use `edit_jhs_` under `JHS`.

 *  changed `lg`, `jodon` to support changes to `18!:4`.

 * `EDCONSOLE` set in `profile.ijs` - useful for setting preferred `jconsole.exe` editor.

 * `JSON`, `PYTHON`, `SQL` macro option text codes added. All JOD macro
    text is stored as bytes. The code is a label. It's useful to apply
    the labels as `JSCRIPT` text is executed while other types are not.

### 0.0.995 - May 28, 2018 (Memorial Day update)

 * added `MIXEDOVER` noun to `namecats` - mixed assignment override tag.

 * first JOD release to the new [Jsoftware GitHub](https://github.com/jsoftware) addon repositories.

### 0.9.993 - May 21, 2018 (test of Jsoftware GIT repos)

 * Behaviour of `dpset 'ROOTFOLDER';'~BLOG'` changed. 
   Prior to this release relative root folders were expanded
   and then added to the `scripts 'v'` list. This resulted in
   `scripts` lines like:
        
		TeXfrWpxml  C:/Users/john2000/jod/docs/script/TeXfrWpxml.ijs
        
   Now `jpath` *configured* strings are not expanded resulting in 
   `scripts` lines like:
        
		TeXfrWpxml  ~BLOG/TeXfrWpxml.ijs
		
   This conforms to how `scripts` handles addons.
        
		plot   ~addons/graphics/plot/plot.ijs
  
 * Support for J 6.01 ended and all versions prior to J 8.07 are
   now on life support.

 * `namecats` changed to fix indirect mixed assignment error.
 
        NB. (globs) was failing on verbs like this 
        NB. - there are no mixed assignments.		
        mixedIndirectAssignError=: 4 : 0
        (MethodArguments)=. 0
        (func)=: [ + 0 * ]
        )
		
 * A new name analysis tag `(<:)=:` has been added to `namecats` to
   override mixed assignments. The following legitimate J pattern 
   is used in a number of JOD words.
   
        NB. override mixed assignments (<:)=:
        NB. (dn) appears to be both local and global
        dn=. (<_2}.ix) ,&.> DTSIXCN
        (dn)=: dat
		
   The previous change exposed this issue in JOD code. Override comments
   have been added to JOD words using this pattern. 		
          
### 0.9.990 - February 27, 2017

 * `et` adjusted to better support editing when running JOD
    in `jconsole.exe` sessions. See `joduserconfigbak.ijs`
    to see how to configure command line editors. 

        NB. Text editor to use when running JOD in (jconsole.exe) on Windows systems
        NB. QT/JHS configurations are not necessarily applied for (jconsole,exe)
        EDCONSOLE_ajodutil_=:'"C:\Program Files (x86)\notepad++\notepad++.exe"'

 *  `jod.pdf` updated.

### 0.9.987 - March 20, 2016 (solistice)

 * `et` adjusted to support `qjide`. JOD generated text now
   opens in `qjide` editor windows. `qjide` must be updated
   to support this feature.
   
        NB. edit in qjide
        ed 'wordname'
   

### 9.9.986 - August 10, 2015

 * `od` readjusted - added `require` commented out as `require`
    may not always execute.

           1 pick 5 od ''
        NB. JOD registrations: 10 Aug 2015 12:04:44
        NB. require 'general/jod'
        3 regd&> }. od'' [ 3 od ''
        regd 'utils';'c:/jod/utils/'
               ....

### 0.9.985 - August 9, 2015

 * `bnl` backup name lists implemented: see `jod.pdf` for details.

 *  new test scripts added to `jodsource` dictionaries for `bnl`.

 * `jod.pdf` updated for `bnl`.

 * `od` adjusted to prefix registration commands with `require 'general/jod'`.

### 0.9.980 - August 1, 2015
  
 * A new tag `(/:)=:` is recognized by `compj`. When this tag is present
   in a word local names are obfuscated by `compj` instead of being shortened. 
   The tag `(-.)=:` overrides obfuscation. Obfuscation can be useful for
   words that run general scripts with `0!:0`.  Obfuscation makes name clashes
   far less likely. The `compj` entry in `jod.pdf` has been updated to
   describe this change. 

 * obsolete `HTML` document index removed from core JOD.

 * large nouns removed from `utils` to reduce download size.

 * `ed` now handles (name,text) and (name,class,text) tables. 

        NB. fetch backup versions of a word and edit
        'rc nct'=: bget <;._1 ' reb.21 reb19 reb.09 reb.07'
        ed nct

        NB. fetch backup group headers and edit
        'rc nct'=: 2 1 bget <;._1 ' ghead.11 boo.11 ghead.09'
        ed nct

        NB. fetch backup macros and edit
        'rc nct'=: 4 bget <;._1 ' we.13 are.09 backed.03 up'
        ed nct

        NB. fetch path words without defining and edit
        'rc nct'=: 0 10 get }. dnl 're'
        ed nct


### 0.9.973 - July 4, 2015 (Independence Day Edition)

 * A negative option code `_14` has been added to `get` and `put` to
   support timestamp serialization. When JOD generates dump scripts
   with `make` it does not include object creation and last change
   timestamps. Hence, when a dump script is run, it resets
   object timestamps to when *it* runs *not when the dictionary
   objects where created or last changed.*  

        NB. name/creation/lastput timestamps
        'rc wts'=: 0 _14 get }. revo ''
        'rc gts'=: 2 _14 get }. 2 revo ''

        NB. (wts,gts) are boxed tables with (blcl) names in the first row and
        NB. floating fractional day (ft) yyyymmdd.fd timestamps in the second

        NB. update put dictionary timestamps 
        0 _14 put wts 
        2 _14 put gts  
        
 * A new `dpset` parameter `RETAINAGE` has been added to control
   dumping timestamps. When `RETAINAGE` exists and is set to `1` 
   timestamps are serialized and appended to dump scripts. The default
   value is `0`. `RETAINAGE` is a new dictionary parameter and will
   not exist in dictionaries created before this version.
   This can be changed by recreating the master file `jmaster.ijf` 
   and reloading dictionaries from dump scripts. See `jod.pdf`
   for more details. Update the `joddocument` addon to get 
   the current `jod.pdf` edition. 
   
        dpset '' NB. show put dictionary parameter settings

        NB. add timestamps to dump scripts
        dpset 'RETAINAGE';1

        NB. dump scripts now contain object timestamps
        make ''

 * `mls` changed to use new `dpset` parameter `ROOTFOLDER`.
   When `ROOTFOLDER` exists and is a `jpath` J configured 
   folder `mls` writes generated scripts to the `jpath` folder.
   If `ROOTFOLDER` does not exist or is not a  configured `jpath` folder
   generated scripts are written to standard dictionary folders.
   `ROOTFOLDER` is also a new parameter and will not exist in
   dictionaries created before this version.  

        dpset '' NB. show put dictionary parameter settings

        NB. set ROOTFOLDER to a J configured folder
        dpset 'ROOTFOLDER';'~user/jodroot'

        NB. generated scripts are now written to the J folder
        mls 'jodgroupname'

 * Improved error handling for many `ijod` *ad hoc* words: see `jodprofile.ijs`.

 * `swex` and `ltx` removed from `jodtools` class. Use `slex` instead of `swex`
   and `mx` for `ltx`. See `jodprofile.ijs`

 * Code formating improved in `jod.pdf` and revisions made for changes to JOD.

### 0.9.972 - April 5, 2015 (Easter Egg Edition)

 * JOD labs updated to run on Win, Mac, Linux systems.

 * Minor changes to `jod.pdf` to support lab changes.

### 0.9.97 - March 22, 2015

 * `newd` changed to not check volume sizes when `FREESPACE` is zero.
   Volume sizing may perform poorly on network volumes and
   fail entirely on "cloud" platforms.

 * JOD builds modified to run on Win, Mac, Linux systems.

 * Dependence on `zfiles` addon removed. `zfiles` depends on 32 bit
   Windows and is not portable.

 * `TestDictionaryDump` removed from main JOD dictionary. This single
   large object bumped up the `jod.ijs` dump script by five megabytes. 
   `TestDictionaryDump` is now stored in `jodtest.ijs` available on GitHub see:
   [jodtest.ijs](https://github.com/bakerjd99/joddumps/blob/win7/jodtest.ijs)

 * Revisions made to PDF document `jod.pdf`. 

 * For more details see the blog post
   [JOD Update: Version 0.9.97*](https://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/jod-update-version-0-9-97/)
   
### 0.9.95 - June 25, 2014

 * `extscopes` changed to handle quoted gerund assignments like:
        
        '`this is ok'=: +`-`* 
        '`more ehh'=. #`$

    this bug resulted in `globs` misclassifying names.

### 0.9.94 - June 14, 2014

 * `et` updated to support J 8.02 editors.

### 0.9.93 - November 22, 2013

 * `nc` verb changed to trap limit errors for very long names.
    The standard J definition throws a limit error for names exceeding
    255 characters. 

### 0.9.92 - March 01, 2013

 * `compj` dyad added. `1 compj ;:'word list'` removes
   comments, preserves leading whitespace and reduces
   multiple blanks lines to one blank line. This representation
   is useful when reading code as it suppresses comment clutter.

### 0.9.90 - January 19, 2013

 *  JOD source code is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    The source is distributed in two repositories:
    
    1. [jod](https://github.com/bakerjd99/jod) contains the files
       distributed with JAL. The additional directory `jodijs` 
       holds fully commented JOD class files.  The standard
       JAL scripts are "compressed."
        
    2. [joddoc](https://github.com/bakerjd99/joddoc) holds all
       the `LaTeX` and supporting files needed to build the
       JOD manual `jod.pdf`.
       
 * Numerous JOD [working dictionaries](https://github.com/bakerjd99/joddumps) 
   are now available on GitHub. 
   
 * `dpset` bug fixed. It was allowing parameter
   changes on `READONLY` dictionaries. Dictionaries 
   must be in a `READWRITE` state to change `dpset ''` parameters. 
        
        dpset 'READWRITE' 
        dpset 'ASCII85';1
        
 * fixed missing `(x,8) disp y` argument option where
   `x` is in `i. 5`. With this change `2 8 disp }.grp''` 
   now displays short group documents just like 
   `2 9 disp }.grp''` displays long documents. 

 * `nt` template strings changed to match the
   strings of `ngc`. `ngc` is a utility verb in the
   distributed JOD dictionaries: see `disp 'ngc'`.
   The template strings are: `{~T~}`, `{~A~}`, `{~D~}`, 
   and `{~SD~}` for  title, author, date (`yyyymondd`) and
   short date (`yymondd`).
   
 * `nt` dyad added.  An `x` argument is 
   a character list of string replacements
   that are applied to `teststub`, see `disp 'teststub'`,
   after template strings are processed. The
   first character in the string delimits
   replacement pairs.
 
        '#change#ME#and#YOU' nt 'newtest'

 * `mg`, `mt`, `mj`, and `tt` removed from `jodtools`. These edit helpers
   are now optionally defined in `~addons/general/jod/jodprofile.ijs`. 

### 0.9.85 - October 13, 2012

 * `jodliterate` group added. See `2 9 disp 'jodliterate'`
   and the blog post [Semi-Literate
   JOD](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/semi-literate-jod/) 
   for details

 * `MARKDOWN` macro text code 27 added.
   
 * `5 disp ''` now displays any overall put dictionary documentation.
 
 *  minor `jod.pdf` edits and additions.
 
 * Starting the process of converting most JOD document 
   text to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 
   including this document.[^1]

### 0.9.80 - July 12, 2012

 * dictionary documents set and fetched with `5 put 'doc ...'`
   and `5 get ''` are now saved in dump scripts. `5 put '..'` 
   is controlled by a new parameter `jodparms.ijs` `DOCUMENTDICT`
   that determines whether `5 put 'doc ..'` stores text. The
   default `DOCUMENTDICT=1` stores text.

 * vestigial `z` locale dump script load utilities `sonl_z_,
   SOLOCALE_z_, soput_z_` and `soclear_z_` are now erased at the
   end of dump script runs. JOD defines exactly four words
   in the z locale: `jodoff_z_, jodon_z_, jodsystempath_z_`
   and `showpass_z_`.

 * `opendict` has been modified to test whether master
   file paths are prefixes of stored dictionary paths. For 
   `READWRITE` dictionaries the prefix must match. For `READONLY`
   dictionaries the master path replaces the stored path in
   dictionary directory objects if they differ. This allows 
   `READONLY` dictionaries to be placed on locked down network 
   drives and accessed by many users that may have different 
   access paths.  
   
 * DEPENDS sections added to JOD and JODSOURCE manifest scripts.
 
 * `jod.pdf` (general/joddocument addon) updated.

### 0.9.75 - June 26, 2012

 * first Mac compatible version of JOD. The Mac version
   requires J 7.01 or beyond see: 

        ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/macnotes.txt
   
 * `jod.pdf` updated and now distributed as a
   separate JAL addon. Install `general/joddocument`
   to place `jod.pdf` in the directories searched
   by `jodhelp`. `jodhelp` no longer looks for an
   online version of `jod.pdf`. 
   
 * fixed a `disp` length error. 
 
 * line ends in all script files set to line feed LF
 
 * labs updated for J 7.01 and Linux/Mac versions
 
 * lab `jodprjm.ijt` removed - this lab referred
   to an old (pre 7.01) project manager. 
  
### 0.9.7 - Jan 16, 2011

 * `jodfork` now calls `fork_jtask_` - done to handle change
   in main J library. `task` verbs are no longer loaded to `z` locale

### 0.9.65 - Dec 19, 2011

 * `get, put` now fetch and set put dictionary documentation.
 
        5 get '' 
        5 put 'document this dictionary' 

### 0.9.6 - Dec 12, 2011

 * `jodhelp` pointed to new online version of `jod.pdf`
   EPS, TEX and HTML document files removed from main jod dictionary
   to reduce the size of `jodsource.zip`. These files
   are available in the online JOD svn repository. 
   See [The JOD Page](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/).
   
 * `compj` can now be limited to only white space removal by 
   inserting the comment tag `(-.)=:` anywhere in the text of
   an explicit word.
   
### 0.9.5 - Dec 4, 2011

 * fixed a `make` bug in `dumpwords` a path of all
   empty dictionaries failed to make.
   
 * fixed an `mls` bug that produced incorrect 
   JOD `startup.ijs` entries on Linux.
   
 * more test cases added.

### 0.9.4 - Nov 25, 2011

 * update `jodindex.html` to reference current online documentation
 
 * fixed a `make` bug - `make` could fail when words with the
   the same name and different name classes were present on
   the path.
   
 * updating and extending JOD tests.
   
### 0.9.3 - Jun 11, 2011

 * online documentation revised and extended. The online documents
   are hosted by Google Documents and can be read on the web or
   downloaded in a variety of formats: PDF, ODT, Word, HTML. The
   offline `jod.pdf` will be revised after collecting user feedback.

### 0.9.2 - May 29, 2011

 * first Linux compatible version of JOD. The Linux version
   requires J 7.01 or beyond see: 

        ~addons/general/jod/joddoc/linuxnotes.txt

 * online documentation, available via the verb `jodhelp`,
   has been converted to the new Google Document format. 
   The conversion process broke all the internal hyperlinks
   I am slowly fixing them. The offline PDF document 
   [`jod.pdf`](http://www.box.net/shared/gajfu50gc0)
   does not show Linux specific examples but is still
   an accurate description of what JOD is all about.

 * additional information about JOD will be made
   available on [my blog](http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com)
   after a round of beta testing in the wild.  

 * this version of JOD runs on windows J 6.0x and J 7.0x systems.
  
### 0.9.1 - May 7, 2011

 * minor fix of edit verb `et` to run on both 7.0x and 6.0x J systems.

### 0.9.0 - Feb 18, 2011

 * modified to run under J 7.01 JHS and JGTK. This version
   also runs on J 6.0x systems.
   
 * replaced JOD's `z` locale interface with an `ijod` interface.
   JOD now defines only three words: `jodon, jodoff` and 
   `jodsystempath` in the `z` locale.  All other interface
   words are defined in `ijod` which is placed on the
   base locale's search path
   
 * path and file displays converted to `jpathsep` conventions.
 
 * `jod.pdf` removed from the core JOD addon package.  `jod.pdf`
   was by far the largest part of the core install package. `jod.pdf`
   is now browsed on-line by `jodhelp`. You can download `jod.pdf`
   and place it in `~addons/general/jod/joddoc/pdfdoc/` to enable
   local PDF reading.
   
 * online JOD documentation updated to reflect changes.
 
 * `UTF8` macro script code changed from 26 to 28 (remember 28 for `UTF8`).
 
 * `BYTE` macro script code added with value 26.  
 
### 0.8.0 - Oct 31, 2008

 * added new `jodparms.ijs` parameter `ASCII85` that controls whether
   dump files use ascii85 for text objects.  Default is 0.
   The ascii85 representation generally produces smaller 
   dump files but is slower than the default method.
   
 * `jodsource` uses ascii85 for JOD development dictionaries to 
   reduce the size of the downloads.
   
 * minor fixes in `jod.pdf`

### 0.7.3 - Oct 7, 2008

 * forced path comparisons to lower case in JOD Lab #4 and test `'setup_jodproject'`
 
 * fixed a few typos in `jod.pdf`

### 0.7.2 - Sep 25, 2008

 * completed dyadic case of `doc`
 
 * updated `jod.pdf` to describe changes

### 0.7.1 - Sep 24, 2008

 * removed some large EPS files from dictionary to reduce download size
 
 * replaced JOD directory diagram in `jod.pdf` - reduces size of j`od.pdf`

### 0.7.0 - Sep 24, 2008

 * references added to `jod.pdf `
 
 * new jod hardcopy [www.lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com) edition
 
### 0.6.0 - Aug 18, 2008

 * minor jod script edits
 
 * `jod.pdf` index improved 
 
### 0.5.1 - Jul 21, 2008

 * `joduserconfig.ijs` added
 
 * `gdeps` now documented in `jod.pdf`
 
### 0.5.0 - Jul 18, 2008

 * `jod.pdf` documentation complete
 
### 0.4.0 - Jul 10, 2008

 * insure at least one group in `joddevload` for lab
 
 * minor lab edits - refer to `startup.ijs` instead of `scripts.ijs`
 
### 0.3.8 - May 31, 2008

 * minor update to last lab section

### 0.3.7 - May 31, 2008

 * bug fixes in labs - all labs can be run

### 0.3.6 - May 29, 2008

 * first release of fully "addon-ized" JOD - versions prior
   to this release had to be manually installed by 
   ad-hoc scripts. Now the JAL system handles JOD installs.
